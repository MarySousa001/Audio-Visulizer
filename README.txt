For best user experience visualising an effect try using fullscreen mode, and also turn off all menus so there's more screen space and you can see it clearer.
[Mention: This project was tested using a local server (instead of Brackets), on which this project did not have/presented any issues]

Dealing with problems:

-We have encountered a few problems, such as loading the songs, but they were dealt with by making a 
Song class and loading the songs on-the-fly. We attempted preload but it's limits were 3 songs, however
with this new method we have at least 9 songs loading and everything works as intended.

Things to keep in mind for future projects:
